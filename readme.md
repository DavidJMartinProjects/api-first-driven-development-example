# API First Driven Development
## Project Description
A simple example of "API First Driven Development" using the OpenAPI and Springboot. 

A predetermined OpenAPI spec is used to generate a REST Controller Interface and its associated response Models.

The generated code is then integrated into the codebase ensuring that the OpenAPI spec is the '<i>single source of truth</i>' that represents the true behavior of the underlying service.

## Frameworks Used
- SpringBoot
- OpenAPI
- SwaggerUI
